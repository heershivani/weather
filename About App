Weather forecasting is the task of predicting the state of the atmosphere at a future time and a specified location. Traditionally, this has been done through physical simulations in which the atmosphere is modeled as a fluid. The present state of the atmosphere is sampled, and the future state is computed by numerically solving the equations of fluid dynamics and thermodynamics. 
Weather simply refers to the condition of air on the earth at a given place and time. It is a continuous, data-intensive, multidimensional, dynamic and chaotic process. These properties make weather forecasting is a formidable challenge. Forecasting is the process of estimation in unknown situations from the historical data.
Weather forecasting is one of the most scientifically and technologically challenging problems around the world in the last century. To make an accurate prediction is indeed, one of the major challenges that meteorologists are facing all over the world. Since ancient times, weather prediction has been one of the most interesting and fascinating domains. Weather forecasting entails predicting how the present state of the atmosphere will change.
Project Scope:
•	Weather forecasts are made by collecting as much data as possible about the current state of the atmosphere (particularly the temperature, humidity and wind) to determine how the atmosphere evolves in the future.
•	However, the chaotic nature of the atmosphere makes the forecasts less accurate as the range of the forecast increases.
•	Traditional observations made at the surface of atmospheric pressure, temperature, wind speed, wind direction, humidity, precipitation are collected routinely from trained
. observers, automatic weather stations or buoys.During the data assimilation process, information gained from the observations is used In conjunction with a numerical model's most recent forecast for the time that observations were made to produce the meteorological analysis. The complicated equations which govern how the state of a fluid changes with time require supercomputers to solve them.
•	The output from this model can be used the weather forecast as alternative.
